Can we use them reliably in investing or trading? Let’s find out. IntroI assume that you already knew the anatomy of a candlestick so I will skip the explanation part. There are dozens of candlestick pattern out there, be it bullish or bearish ones, what we wanted to know is that can we used them reliably in our investing and trading activities. Methodology - Skip this part if you’re not into techIt is possible to handcode a program to identify every pattern but that will be a lot of workload. Fortunately, there is a python library called TA-Lib, which included the identification of candlestick pattern given price data. In this study, 10 years worth of daily price data (Open, Low, High, Close) was scraped online and saved into a .csv file. I have written a piece of code that will iterate over the price data to find candlestick pattern. Comment below if you wanted a copy of the code and data. ResultsThe performance of each candlestick is measured by how likely it will go up in (1,5,10,30) days. A win rate of 0.7 means that in 7 out of 10 times the price will go up after the pattern appeared. Here is the best and worst 5 candlestick patterns. Wanted more? Here’s the entire backtesting results! Very surprisingly some bullish pattern has very low win rate, my thinking is that when a pattern is too widely known and used, the edge of the pattern diminishes as everyone knows the information making it useless. Besides, the findings also showed very little pattern with winrate more than 50% (I thought I will found my golden formula here :disappointed: ). However there is some relatively high winrate patterns with winrate over 0.45. Perhaps with enough risk management techniques you might be able to construct a consistently profitable strategy. Some AfterthoughtsOf course there are something this study misses, for example, some candlestick pattern are only effective while they are on top of the trend etc. Nevertheless this brings me a general view of the effectiveness of candlestick pattern. I am wondering combined with other technical indicators will the winrate be higher? Also, the low winrate doesn’t mean that it is worthless. A 20% winrate indicats there it is 80% likely that the price will drop tomorrow. How about using this as a indicator for shorting of stocks? Well, I leave this to you guys to figure out. Let me know what you think in the comments. This study is purely for discovery and fun. Please be responsible of your own money and trade at your own risk.","link":"/first-md/"},{"title":"Is stock picking based on PE useful?","text":"Whether it’s PE, ROE, DY there are tons of financial jargons and financial ratios out there. The value investors emphasize on buying cheap (low PE, PB), while growth investors focus on buying stocks with high growth (high ROE etc). How do we know which ratio is the most useful to find out potentially profitable stocks? Let’s find out. IntroductionFor today’s topic, I am going to introduce a backtesting tool that I have developed myself during free time. https://www.klsequant.com So what’s the main goal/function of this web app? Say that you have a stock picking strategy that you wanted to test out. For example, buy a stock when PE is below 10 while ROE is above 20. Then you can backtest your strategy, to see how well your stock picking strategy has performed over the last 10 years (The dataset is from 2010 to 2019). This is a web app based on Python Flask framework and this is a new challenge for me because I have only coded in Python but never in web environment. I coded the app and hosted in on pythonanywhere, definitely check them out if you are a Python guy. Brief explanation of the user interface Let me have a basic introduction to the user interface. There is 14 inputs for you, the maximum number of shares field however must be filled, the other fields are fill solely based on your stock pick criteria. Usage demonstrationFor demonstration purpose, the strategy I am using are buy when (Maximum number of stocks to buy is 10, PE is below 10, ROE is above 15 and DY above 3). If a stock fulfills the criteria it will get chosen to backtest the performance. I am using monthly frequency here (which mean the frequency you change your position to buy new stocks as the criteria might change over time for a stock) but there are plenty of choices for frequency for you to experiment as well. Let’s see how the performance goes. We gt a compounded annual growth rate (Cagr) of 36%. That is not bad at all! It is also shown that the strategy outperforms the KLSE index (the red line) as well. The program assumes that you start with capital of RM1,000. Here’s some explanation of the output. The green line is the capital growth of your stock picking strategy. The red line corresponds to performance of KLSE index. We take the performance of KLSE index as benchmark so we know have we got a better return than simply buying KLSE ETF and hold. The maximum return the strategy achieved is 48.3%, with worst return of -13.81%. On average, each trade generates 2.59% of return. The compounded annual growth rate of the strategy is 36%. The strategy also outperforms KLSE index greatly, with RM1,000 invested, you will get RM16,000 in return whereas KLSE only provide RM1,131 in return. This table is the stocks that fulfilled the stock picking criteria you defined. It gives you a rough idea what stocks will be picked based on your strategy. Why is there only 3 stocks bought in some months? It is because during the month no other stocks fulfill the stock picking criteria so only a little stocks are bought. (**Can you notice that this strategy captures super long bullish stock like Vitrox?) AfterthoughtsLet’s have a little experiment before we call it a day. How about high PE stocks vs low PE stocks? The criteria is as follow: Number of Stocks to buy : 10 Minimum ROE: 10Let’s see with the same ROE, how will PE change the profitability of a stock picking strategy?Here’s the result High PE strategy Low PE strategy The results are pretty clear that low PE DO outperform high PE stocks over time. But this is a very generalized idea, as we can see that overpriced stocks CAN get more expensive also (Like how glove counters’ PE went from 60 to 100). Howard Marks has a saying “An overpriced stock doesn’t mean that it will drop tomorrow”. But generally speaking, low PE stock does offer a better return. LimitationsThere are limitations to this web app as well. I’ll list several of them. First, there is no technical analysis picking criteria (maybe in future? If you guys loved it I will develop this feature) Second, there is no transaction fees calculated (which might eat away a huge chunk of your profit if your capital is small) Well this marks the end of this post. Do let me know if you have any feedback whether it’s good or bad. Comment below so I know what you think (I do read the comments).","link":"/Introduction-to-klsequant/"},{"title":"Magic formula of rule of 72. Why is it 72?","text":"How did mathematicians come up with the Rule of 72?? Why not 71 or 73? Rule of 72The rule of 72 is a simple formula to estimate the time that you need to double your investment based on your return. For example, how long you need to double your investment given 20% return? time = 72/x time = 72/20 time = 3.6 yearsHow to proof? 1 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 = 2.07Close enough right? Ever wondered where did the 72 come from? Here’s the proof.Given the formula for future value is FV = PV x (1+x)^t FV = Future Value PV = Present Value r = return t = timeIf we want to double our investment, our PV must be multiplied by 2, we end up with 2PV = PV (1+r)^t 2 = (1+r)^tLet’s add natural logarithm to both sides ln(2) = t ln(1+r) t = ln(2) / ln(1+r)According to taylor series expansion, $ln(1+r) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} …..$ However, if r is very small, we can safely assume that $\\ ln(1+r) \\approx r$Thus making t = ln(2)/r t = 0.693/rMake it easier, we make it $\\times100$ t = 69.3/rBut hey! It is not 72 right?! Yeah, yeah, let me explain. 69 is only easily divisible by 1,3,23,69.To make this formula more convenient people decide to use 72 instead. Note that 72 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,18,24,36,72. To conclude, the rule of 72 is very good to estimate how long your investment can double. You might wonder, how far off is the value of using this formula? Well, I have made a graph below, the higher the return is, the bigger the error But this just serves as an estimation so it is good enough for most scenario. Good enough right? You tell me","link":"/Rule-of-72/"},{"title":"RM300 a year for 10 years?","text":"What the heck is dollar cost averaging strategy and does it work? IntroductionDollar cost averaging is a systematic strategy that allows you to buy more when price is cheap, buy less when price is high. This is a popular strategy among stock investors as well as mutual fund investors. In the long run your average buying price will be very favourable because you bought more when price is cheap. MethodologyI have gathered 10 years worth of stock market data, SP500, SGX, Shanghai Index and KLSE. I simulated dollar cost averaging by buying into the stock index every month with RM300. People always said dollar cost averaging is a good strategy, is it so? Let’s look at the results. ResultsThe results… are mixed. If you bought SP500 10 years ago, you would have gained 70% on your investment. However, if you bought KLSE or SGX, you end up losing money, 20% of it. Is all this effort worth it? Key Takeaways the risk/reward ratio is still great. You get 70% upside and -20% downside, when risking the 20% you can potentially get 70%. Diversification is great for layman. I mean, if you don’t have the skills and knowledge needed to put your bets, diversification is a way to go. Stocks are still great for long term investment, this doesn’t count in where you buy more during dips, the results will certainly be better. How can I buy the index? Through ETFs and mutual funds. ETFs are great, they have low costs, tracks the index well, however, ETFs in Malaysia are still premature, volumes are low, spreads are high (inefficient market makers). The other option is mutual fund. Most of them costs some charges, but their nature of open-ended funds, you can buy them using their NAV price, don’t have to worry about spreads and volume. They still serve as a good option for diversification.

Full Equity, Full Bond or 50/50?","text":"How do you achieve capital growth while controlling your risk? IntroductionPeople often equates return and risk, giving statements like “high risk high return”. If high risk does secure you high return, is the investment considered high risk anymore? I find Howard Marks return vs risk graph a nice way to visualize risk. According to him, the higher the risk, the more variability your return becomes. Different asset classes have their inherent risk. Equity asset often relates to people as higher risk, because sometimes it delivers higher return and sometimes lower return compared to other asset classes, with ranges in (-20 to 50% We are talking about overall equity market here).A lot of factors can play with an equity’s risk, market condition, company earnings, new competitor and etc. Bond asset is often considered as low risk asset, because of the return of the asset is fixed (sometimes also called fixed income asset), it has lesser variability in their returns (3 to 8%).Bond on the other hand, the main risk is the company going bankrupt, defaulting on the bond you are holding. John Bogle’s strategyJohn Bogle the founder of The Vanguard Group, an american fund management giant. His investment strategy is to allocate equity/bond with ratio of 50/50. Every year, you will need to rebalance your portfolio. For example Stock Bond 5500 5100 you will need to take 400 from equity asset to bond asset, make the ratio 50/50 again. The rationale behind this is to “balance” the portfolio, a higher equity price might mean overvalued equity, hence reducing your position on overvalued asset.Vice versa, when the equity price is low, you shift money from bond to equity, to buy more of the undervalued asset. How about Modern Portfolio Theory?The Nobel prize winner Markowitz doesn’t even use the strategy himself, “I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it — or if it went way down and I was completely in it. So I split my contributions 50/50 between stocks and bonds.” So it seems like Markowitz himself is using a 50/50 portfolio instead of the Modern Portfolio Theory that won him a Nobel Prize. https://www.mymoneyblog.com/harry-markowitz-personal-investment-portfolio.html MethodologyThe data I am using are funds from a local unit trust giant company P. The equity funds I used are Global Equity Fund, East-Asia Equity Fund, Malaysia Index Fund. They well represent the whole equity market as a whole.The bond fund I used are Enhanced Bond Fund. The data used are from 2006 to 2020, to visualize the long term returns. I am using Python for the calculation (because it is vastly easier than MS Excel), if you are interested please drop me an email. Results Full Equity Full Bond 50/50 Equity Return 270% 105% 244% Asset Value in 2020 27142 18664 24482 Lowest point 9971 10532 11191 Some might point out that volatility isn’t a bad thing, but I think we can agree that volatility is not for the fainted heart. No all of us can sleep well when our portfolio is down 20%, with a nice spiced combo, we can sleep well while not sacrificing a big chunk of your return. What if you added more every year?What if we added RM1000 every year (A rather small amount)?As expected, the portfolio will grow a lot faster. Key Takeaways Nice risk/reward ratio. Reduced volatility while preserving returns. Diversification don’t necessary take away a lot of your return. The 50/50 combo is only a 10% (RM2600 difference) worse than full equity combo, with lesser volatility. We cannot rebalance our portfolio too often because it might incur charges.
